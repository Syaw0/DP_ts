# State



The state design pattern is like having different suits for different occasions. Just like you wear different clothes for different activities, a program can have different "states" that it can be in, and each state has its own set of behaviors or actions.

Let's imagine you have a toy car that can move forward, backward, and stop. The car can be in different states depending on what it is doing. When you press the "forward" button, it goes forward. When you press the "backward" button, it goes backward. And when you press the "stop" button, it stops moving.

In the state design pattern, we would create a separate class for each state of the car, such as "ForwardState", "BackwardState", and "StopState". Each of these classes would have its own set of methods, or behaviors, that the car can perform while in that state. For example, the ForwardState class would have a "move forward" method, but it wouldn't have a "move backward" method.

When the user presses a button on the toy car, the car object would switch to the appropriate state object, based on the button that was pressed. So if the "forward" button was pressed, the car object would switch to the ForwardState object, and then it would be able to move forward.

By using the state design pattern, we can make our programs more flexible and easier to maintain, because we can add new states or behaviors without having to change the existing code. It's like having a wardrobe full of different clothes for different occasions, so you're always ready for anything!
