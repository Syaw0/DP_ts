# Strategy


Imagine you have a toy box with different kinds of toys - some are cars, some are dolls, some are blocks. Each toy is different and has its own unique features. 

Now, let's say you want to play a game with these toys where you need to organize them based on their type. You can use the strategy design pattern to do this. 

The strategy design pattern is like having a helper who knows how to sort things. This helper can look at each toy and figure out what type it is - a car, a doll, or a block - and then put it in the right pile. 

So, you can tell your helper to sort all the cars in one pile, all the dolls in another pile, and all the blocks in a third pile. The helper knows what to do because you gave it instructions on how to sort the toys. 

In programming, we use the strategy design pattern to organize different parts of our code based on their functionality. For example, we might have different sorting algorithms that we want to use depending on the situation. We can use the strategy design pattern to select the right algorithm based on the input we're given.
