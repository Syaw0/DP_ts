# Observer (Event-Subscriber , Listener)


Sure! The observer design pattern is like having a baby monitor. 

Imagine you are a baby, and your parents want to be able to take care of you but still move around the house. They set up a baby monitor that stays with you, and a device that they can carry around with them. 

Whenever you cry or need your parents, they can hear you through the baby monitor and come to help you. The device that your parents carry around is like an observer that listens for any changes in your behavior, and notifies them so they can take action.

In software development, the observer design pattern is used to notify one or more objects when a state or property changes in another object. For example, imagine you have a messaging application and you want to notify users when a new message arrives.

You can use the observer design pattern to create a messaging object that other objects can subscribe to. When a new message arrives, the messaging object notifies all the subscribers so they can update their user interface and show the new message.

So, the observer design pattern is like having a baby monitor or a listening device that notifies objects of any changes or updates.
