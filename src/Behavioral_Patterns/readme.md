# Behavioral Patterns


**Behavioral design pattern is a category of design patterns that deals with the behavior of objects in a system and how they interact with one another . It is concerned with the assignment of responsibilities between objects , ensuring communication between them and helping them work together more effectively . Behavioral design patterns include patterns such as :**


<br/>

###  1. [Chain Of Responsibility](https://github.com/Syaw0/Design-Patterns/tree/master/src/Behavioral_Patterns/Chain_Of_Responsibility)



The Chain of Responsibility pattern allows you to pass requests along a chain of handlers until one of them can handle it .
<br/>

###  2. [Command(Action,Transaction)](https://github.com/Syaw0/Design-Patterns/tree/master/src/Behavioral_Patterns/Command)


The Command pattern encapsulates a request as an object , thereby allowing parameterization of clients with different requests , queueing or logging requests , and support for undoable operations .
<br/>

###  3. [Mediator(Intermediary,Controller)](https://github.com/Syaw0/Design-Patterns/tree/master/src/Behavioral_Patterns/Mediator)

The mediator design pattern allows objects to communicate with each other through a mediator object , reducing the direct dependencies between them .

<br/>

###  4. [Memento(Snapshot)](https://github.com/Syaw0/Design-Patterns/tree/master/src/Behavioral_Patterns/Memento)


The Memento pattern provides the ability to capture and restore an object's internal state without violating encapsulation .

<br/>

###  5. [Observer(Listener,Event-subscriber)](https://github.com/Syaw0/Design-Patterns/tree/master/src/Behavioral_Patterns/Observer)



The Observer pattern allows one object to notify other objects automatically when it changes its state , so that they can update themselves accordingly .

<br/>


###  6. [State](https://github.com/Syaw0/Design-Patterns/tree/master/src/Behavioral_Patterns/State)

The State pattern allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes .


<br/>



###  7. [Strategy](https://github.com/Syaw0/Design-Patterns/tree/master/src/Behavioral_Patterns/Strategy)


The Strategy pattern defines a family of interchangeable algorithms and enables them to be used interchangeably within a context object .

<br/>




###  8. [Template](https://github.com/Syaw0/Design-Patterns/tree/master/src/Behavioral_Patterns/Template)

The Template Method pattern defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class and allows subclasses to fill in the details without changing the overall algorithm .

<br/>





###  9. [Visitor](https://github.com/Syaw0/Design-Patterns/tree/master/src/Behavioral_Patterns/Visitor)


The Visitor pattern allows for the separation of an algorithm ( visitor ) from the object structure it operates on by adding a visitor interface to each element of the object structure .
