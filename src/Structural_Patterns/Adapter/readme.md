# Adapter Pattern


Imagine you have a toy car that only fits on a specific track. But your friend has a different track and you really want to play with your car on their track. So, you use an adapter to make your car fit on their track. The adapter changes the shape of your car's wheels so that it can fit and run smoothly on your friend's track. 

In programming, the adapter design pattern works similarly. It helps two incompatible interfaces work together by creating a middle layer (adapter) that translates one interface into another. For example, if you have a device that only works with USB-A ports but your computer only has USB-C ports, you can use a USB-C to USB-A adapter to connect them. The adapter acts as a bridge between the two different interfaces and allows them to communicate with each other.
