# One real world example of the Composite design pattern in Python is a file system. In a file system, a directory can contain files and other directories, and each directory and file can be treated as a single entity. The Composite design pattern can be used to represent this hierarchical structure in a way that allows the client code to treat both directories and files uniformly.

# Here is an example of how the Composite design pattern can be implemented in Python for a file system:


class FileSystemComponent:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        
    def display(self):
        pass

class File(FileSystemComponent):
    def display(self):
        print(self.name)

class Directory(FileSystemComponent):
    def __init__(self, name):
        super().__init__(name)
        self.children = []
        
    def add(self, component):
        self.children.append(component)
        
    def remove(self, component):
        self.children.remove(component)
        
    def display(self):
        print(self.name)
        for child in self.children:
            child.display()


# In this example, `FileSystemComponent` is the base class for both files and directories. `File` and `Directory` are the leaf and composite classes respectively. `Directory` has a list of children components, which can be either files or directories. The `add` and `remove` methods allow the client code to add or remove components from a directory.

# To use the Composite design pattern in a file system application, the client code can create a directory and add files and other directories to it:


root = Directory('root')
file1 = File('file1')
file2 = File('file2')
subdir = Directory('subdir')
file3 = File('file3')

subdir.add(file3)
root.add(file1)
root.add(file2)
root.add(subdir)

root.display() # displays the entire file system hierarchy


# In this example, `root` is the top-level directory, which contains `file1`, `file2`, and `subdir`. `subdir` contains `file3`. When `root.display()` is called, it displays the entire file system hierarchy, including all files and directories. The Composite design pattern allows the client code to treat both files and directories uniformly, which makes it easier to work with the file system hierarchy.
