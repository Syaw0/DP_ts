# caching proxy . this proxy acts as an intermediary between the client and the server, caching responses from the server to improve performance.

Here's an example implementation:

python
import requests

class CachingProxy:
    def __init__(self):
        self.cache = {}

    def get(self, url):
        if url in self.cache:
            print(f"Retrieving {url} from cache")
            return self.cache[url]
        else:
            print(f"Retrieving {url} from server")
            response = requests.get(url)
            self.cache[url] = response.text
            return response.text


# In this implementation, the `CachingProxy` class has a `cache` dictionary that stores responses from the server. When a client requests a URL using the `get` method, the proxy first checks if the response is in the cache. If it is, it returns the cached response. If not, it retrieves the response from the server using the `requests` library, caches it, and returns it to the client.

# This caching proxy can be used in applications that make frequent requests to external APIs or web services. By caching responses, it can significantly reduce the amount of time and resources needed to retrieve data from these services, improving overall performance.
