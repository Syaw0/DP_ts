# Here's an example of Facade design pattern code in Ruby that can be used in a web application:


# Facade class
class WebPageFacade
  def initialize(user_id)
    @user_id = user_id
  end

  def display_page
    user = fetch_user_data(@user_id)
    posts = fetch_user_posts(@user_id)
    comments = fetch_user_comments(@user_id)

    # Render the page using the data obtained above
    render_page(user, posts, comments)
  end

  private

  # Methods to fetch data from various sources
  def fetch_user_data(user_id)
    # Code to fetch user data from the database
  end

  def fetch_user_posts(user_id)
    # Code to fetch user posts from the database
  end

  def fetch_user_comments(user_id)
    # Code to fetch user comments from the database
  end

  # Method to render the page using the data obtained above
  def render_page(user, posts, comments)
    # Code to render the web page using the data obtained above
  end
end

# Usage example
web_page = WebPageFacade.new(current_user.id)
web_page.display_page


# In this example, we have a `WebPageFacade` class that acts as a facade for a web page. The `WebPageFacade` class encapsulates the complexity of obtaining and rendering data for a web page. It exposes a simple `display_page` method that can be used by other parts of the application to display the web page.

# The `display_page` method internally calls three private methods (`fetch_user_data`, `fetch_user_posts`, and `fetch_user_comments`) to obtain the necessary data for the web page. It then calls the `render_page` method to render the web page using the obtained data.

# The usage example shows how the `WebPageFacade` class can be used in a web application. We create a new instance of the `WebPageFacade` class and pass the current user's ID to its constructor. We then call the `display_page` method to display the web page for the current user.

# Overall, this example demonstrates how the Facade design pattern can be used to simplify the complexity of obtaining and rendering data for a web page in a web application.
