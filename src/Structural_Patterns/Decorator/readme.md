# Decorator Pattern

Imagine you have a plain cupcake. You want to make it look fancier by adding some frosting and sprinkles. The cupcake is the original object, and the frosting and sprinkles are the decorations. 

In the same way, the Decorator design pattern allows you to add extra functionality to an object without changing its original structure. The original object is decorated with additional features, just like the cupcake is decorated with frosting and sprinkles. 

For example, let's say you have a class called "Car" that has basic features like speed, color, and model. You can use the Decorator pattern to add extra features like a GPS system or heated seats, without changing the original "Car" class. This way, you can create different variations of the original object with different combinations of features, just like you can create different variations of cupcakes with different types of frosting and sprinkles.
