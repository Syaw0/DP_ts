# Flyweight Pattern



The Flyweight pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to share or reuse objects that have similar or identical state data between multiple contexts or clients . It is used to optimize memory usage by minimizing the number of objects that need to be created . In this pattern , a group of objects with similar properties is represented by a single shared object . The shared object contains the common data that is used by a group of similar objects . The individual objects contain only their specific characteristics that are different from the shared object .
