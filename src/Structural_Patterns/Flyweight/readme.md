# Flyweight Pattern


The Flyweight design pattern is like sharing toys with your friends. Imagine you have a lot of toy cars, but your friends don't have any. Instead of giving each friend their own car, you let them share your cars. That way, you don't have to buy as many cars and your friends can still play with them.

In programming, the Flyweight pattern is used to save memory by sharing objects that have the same properties. For example, if you have a game with a lot of trees, instead of creating a new tree object for each tree in the game, you can create one tree object and share it among all the trees. This saves memory because you only need to store the properties of the tree once, instead of storing them for every single tree in the game.

So, just like sharing toys with your friends, the Flyweight pattern is about sharing objects to save memory.
