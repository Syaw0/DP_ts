# One real-world example of the Flyweight design pattern in Python could be a text editor application that allows users to create and edit documents. In this application, the Flyweight pattern can be used to optimize memory usage by reusing common character objects instead of creating new ones every time a character is added to the document.

# Here's an example implementation of the Flyweight pattern in Python:


class Character:
    def __init__(self, char):
        self.char = char

class CharacterFactory:
    characters = {}

    @classmethod
    def get_character(cls, char):
        if char not in cls.characters:
            cls.characters[char] = Character(char)
        return cls.characters[char]

class Document:
    def __init__(self):
        self.characters = []

    def add_character(self, char):
        self.characters.append(CharacterFactory.get_character(char))

    def print_document(self):
        print(''.join([char.char for char in self.characters]))


# In this code, we have a `Character` class that represents a single character in the document. We also have a `CharacterFactory` class that keeps track of all the characters that have been created so far and returns existing characters if they already exist.

# When we create a new `Document` object and add characters to it using the `add_character` method, we use the `CharacterFactory` to get the corresponding `Character` object. This way, we avoid creating new `Character` objects for characters that already exist in the document.

# Finally, when we want to print the document using the `print_document` method, we simply concatenate all the characters in the document and print them out.

# This implementation of the Flyweight pattern can help reduce memory usage in text editor applications that deal with large documents containing many repeated characters. By reusing existing character objects instead of creating new ones, we can optimize performance and improve the user experience.
