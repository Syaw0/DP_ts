# Factory Method

Imagine you are making a pizza. You have different types of toppings, like cheese, pepperoni, and vegetables. But you don't want to make all the pizzas yourself, you want someone else to make them for you. So, you ask your friends to make the pizzas for you. However, each friend likes different toppings and makes their pizza in a different way.

To solve this problem, you create a "Pizza Factory". This factory has a specific way of making pizza, and it can make different types of pizzas based on your friends' preferences. For example, if your friend likes cheese, the factory will make a cheese pizza for them. If they like vegetables, the factory will make a vegetable pizza.

The "Pizza Factory" is the factory method design pattern. It is a way of creating objects (in this case, pizzas) without specifying the exact class of object that will be created. The factory method pattern allows you to delegate the creation of objects to a separate class (the factory), which can create objects based on specific requirements or preferences.
