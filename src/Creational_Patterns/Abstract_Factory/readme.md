# Abstract Factory

The abstract factory design pattern is like a toy factory that makes different kinds of toys. Imagine you want to make a toy car or a toy plane. Instead of making them separately, you can use an abstract factory to make both toys at the same time. 

The abstract factory has a set of instructions for making different types of toys, like toy cars and toy planes. When you ask the abstract factory to make a toy, it uses those instructions to create the right kind of toy for you.

For example, if you ask the abstract factory to make a toy car, it will follow the instructions for making a toy car and give you a toy car. If you ask it to make a toy plane, it will follow the instructions for making a toy plane and give you a toy plane.

This way, you can make different types of toys without having to create new instructions each time. The abstract factory takes care of all the details for you.
