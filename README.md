# Intent

Have you ever looked at yourself when you are deeply engaged in a heavy project?
Yes, that's what I mean. When you are deeply busy thinking about how you got to a bug or when you want to add a new feature to the program, you spend long hours adding codes and removing and connecting different parts.
What the hell!
And at this moment, the design patterns come towards us like heavenly angels...
no joke, Design patterns help us to solve common problems so that after continuous practice for many common problems of application development, you can implement wonderful and optimal architectures to solve these problems easily!
</br>
Design Patterns saved my ass, so I decided to share my knowledge and others on this repo.
I hope it helps you become a better developer :)

# Category

**Patterns commonly split to three section...**

1. [**Creational Pattern**](#1-creational-pattern)
2. [**Structural Pattern**](#2-structural-pattern)
3. [**Behavioral Pattern**](#3-behavioral-pattern)

lets learn about them !

</br>


## 1. Creational Pattern
*Creational patterns focus on separating the system of creating objects from the main logical system, in this case the construction and matters related to the creation of new objects become very flexible. These patterns provide different mechanisms for creating objects and allow Reuse the existing code!*


<br/>


- [**Factory Method**](https://github.com/Syaw0/Design-Patterns/tree/master/src/Creational_Patterns/Factory_Method)
- [**Abstract Factory**](https://github.com/Syaw0/Design-Patterns/tree/master/src/Creational_Patterns/Abstract_Factory)
- [**Builder**](https://github.com/Syaw0/Design-Patterns/tree/master/src/Creational_Patterns/Builder)
- [**Prototype**](https://github.com/Syaw0/Design-Patterns/tree/master/src/Creational_Patterns/Prototype)
- [**Singleton**](https://github.com/Syaw0/Design-Patterns/tree/master/src/Creational_Patterns/Singleton)

<br/>

## 2. Structural Pattern

**Structure design patterns explain how different objects and classes can be assembled with each other and larger structure and at the same time keep the structure flexible and efficient.**

 <br/>

- [**Adaptart**](https://github.com/Syaw0/Design-Patterns/tree/master/src/Structural_Patterns/Adapter)
- [**Bridge**](https://github.com/Syaw0/Design-Patterns/tree/master/src/Structural_Patterns/Bridge)
- [**Composite(Object Tree)**](https://github.com/Syaw0/Design-Patterns/tree/master/src/Structural_Patterns/Composite)
- [**Decorator**](https://github.com/Syaw0/Design-Patterns/tree/master/src/Structural_Patterns/Decorator)
- [**Facade**](https://github.com/Syaw0/Design-Patterns/tree/master/src/Structural_Patterns/Facade)
- [**Flyweight(Cache)**](https://github.com/Syaw0/Design-Patterns/tree/master/src/Structural_Patterns/Flyweight)
- [**Facade**](https://github.com/Syaw0/Design-Patterns/tree/master/src/Structural_Patterns/Facade)
- [**Proxy**](https://github.com/Syaw0/Design-Patterns/tree/master/src/Structural_Patterns/Proxy)


<br/>

## 3. Behavioral Pattern

*Behavior patterns simply is  to create and control the connection between objects and also how we interact with this objects*

- [**Chain Of Responsibility**]()
- [**Command(Action,Transaction)**]()
- [**Iterator**]()
- [**Mediator(Intermediary,Controller)**]()
- [**Memento(Snapshot)**]()
- [**Observer(Listener,Event-subscriber)**]()
- [**State**]()
- [**Strategy**]()
- [**Template**]()
- [**Visitor**]()
