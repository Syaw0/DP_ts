<h1>Intent</h1>
<p>
Have you ever looked at yourself when you are deeply engaged in a heavy project?
Yes, that's what I mean. When you are deeply busy thinking about how you got to a bug or when you want to add a new feature to the program, you spend long hours adding codes and removing and connecting different parts.
What the hell!
And at this moment, the design patterns come towards us like heavenly angels...
</p>

  <p>
  no joke, Design patterns help us to solve common problems so that after continuous practice for many common problems of application development, you can implement wonderful and optimal architectures to solve these problems easily!
 </br>
 Design Patterns saved my ass, so I decided to share my knowledge and others on this repo.
I hope it helps you become a better developer :)
